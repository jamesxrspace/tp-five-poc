# Overview

All Tests projects are not applying rulesets.

SCG.ToString.CodeGen is still in experiment, no test project for it.

All code gen has to use .Net Standard 2.0.

## SCG.Utility

This part is the code from open source(forgot which one this is from, will add it back once found again), no plan to adjust it in any way for now.
